Version: 0.3

This is my first project using Python and Django and the purpose of this project is purely educational, moreover there are not so many nice web interfaces for memcached... Any suggestions are welcome.

Requirements: django 1.2 or newer

Config:

- Add marmaladed to your INSTALLED_APPS setting:

	INSTALLED_APPS = (
		# ...
		'marmaladed',
	)
	   
- Add the urls to your url configuration::

	urlpatterns = patterns('',
		# ...
		(r'^marmaladed/', include('marmaladed.urls')),
	)
