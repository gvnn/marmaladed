This is my first django project, I built this tool just because I wanted to have a bit of fun and evaluate the framework... Any suggestions are welcome.

Requirements: django 1.2 or newer

Config:

- Add marmaladed to your INSTALLED_APPS setting:

	INSTALLED_APPS = (
		# ...
		'marmaladed',
	)
	   
- Add the urls to your url configuration::

	urlpatterns = patterns('',
		# ...
		(r'^marmaladed/', include('marmaladed.urls')),
	)
